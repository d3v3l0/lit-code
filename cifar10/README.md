# LIT: Learned Intermediate Representation Training

We provide pytorch implementations for the paper LIT: bLockwise Intermediate Representation Training for Model Compression
The code was written by Animesh Koratana and Daniel Kang. 

### Pretrained models
We provide the pretrained models for ResNet on CIFAR10. The models are available
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YURJa9dYItbIPEl7993VuP6u4zq3hZG7).

### CIFAR10 Training
This folder provides the code for training on CIFAR10. The parameters are in
`main.py`.
