# LIT: Learned Intermediate Representation Training

We provide pytorch implementations for the paper LIT: bLockwise Intermediate Representation Training for Model Compression
The code was written by Animesh Koratana and Daniel Kang. 

### Pretrained models
We provide the pretrained models for ResNet on CIFAR10. The models are available
[here](TODO).

### CIFAR10 Training
This folder provides the code for training on CIFAR10. The parameters are in
`main.py`.
